This repository provides a computational tool for predicting the static equilibrium of general bending-active structures in
the form of a network of elements using the dynamic relaxation method. The implemented method is presented in an accompanying publication: ["A computational tool for the analysis of 3D bending-active
structures based on the dynamic relaxation method"](https://unipiit-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/m_iason_studenti_unipi_it/EeB8B0ARbjpPhLV13I8PauEB3KjtqwkAINfavZItYT_SeA?e=YCnmec).
